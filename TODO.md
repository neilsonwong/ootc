Questions to answer:
	Do we want user accounts?
		Pro: admin account, registration account
		Con: users have to remember pw + login details etc

	Figure out elementary screen designs
		KEY: Admin Setup Schedule Page
		everything else (can be dev guessed as long as we are consistent)

	Potential Blockers:
		QR Code scanner integration (need to investigate free js solutions)

			looks easy, we will see
